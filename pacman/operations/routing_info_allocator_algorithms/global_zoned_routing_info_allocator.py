        Keys will have the format:
              <--- 32 bits --->
        Key:  | A | M | P | X |
        Mask: |11111111111|   | (i.e. 1s covering A, M and P fields)

        A: the index of the application vertex
        M: the index of the machine vertex of the application vertex
        P: the index of the outgoing edge partition of the machine vertex
        X: space for the maximum number of keys required by any outgoing edge
           partition

        Note that this also means that all machine vertices of the same
        application vertex will have a shared key.

        The widths of the fields are determined such that every key will have
        every field in the same place in the key, and the mask is the same
        for every vertex.

    .. note::
        No special constraints are supported.  This will only work if the
        numbers above add up to 32-bits (an error will result if not).  A
        single large vertex (like a retina) and lots of small vertices (like
        a large neural network) will thus not likely work here.
