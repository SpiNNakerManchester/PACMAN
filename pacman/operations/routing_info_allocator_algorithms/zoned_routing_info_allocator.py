class ZonedRoutingInfoAllocator(object):
    """ A routing key allocator that uses fixed zones that are the same for
        all vertices.  This will hopefully make the keys more compressible.

        Keys will have the format:
              <--- 32 bits --->
        Key:  | AP | M | X |
        Mask: |11111111111|   | (i.e. 1s covering AP and M fields)

        A: the index of the application vertex
        P: the index of the name of outgoing edge partition of the vertex.
        M: the index of the machine vertex of the application vertex
        X: space for the maximum number of keys required by any outgoing edge
           partition

        The A and P are combined into a single index so that applications with
        multiple partitions use multiple entries
        while ones with only 1 use just one.

        The split between the AP bit and other parts is always fixed
        This also means that all machine vertices of the same
        application vertex and partition will have a shared key.

        The split between the M and X may vary depending on how the allocator
        is called.

        In "global" mode the widths of the fields are pre determined and fixed
        such that every key will have every field in the same place in the key,
        and the mask is the same for every vertex.
         The global approach is particularly sensitive to the one large and
         many small vertices limit.

        In "flexible" mode the size of the M and X will change for each
        application/partition. Every vertex for a application/partition pair
        but different pairs may have different masks.
        This should result in less gaps between the machine vertexes.


    .. note::
        No special constraints (except ContiguousKeyRangeContraint) are
        supported.  This will only work if the numbers above add up to 32-bits
        (an error will result if not).  A single large vertex (like a retina)
        and lots of small vertices (like a large neural network)
        will thus not likely work here.
