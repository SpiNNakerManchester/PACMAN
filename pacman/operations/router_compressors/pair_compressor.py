class PairCompressor(AbstractCompressor):
    """ Routing Table compressor based on brute force. \
    Finds mergable pairs to replace.

    This algorithm assumes unordered routing tables and returns \
    a possibly ordered routing tables. If unordered it can be used \
    as a precompressor for another that makes use of order.

    In the simplest format the algorithm is:

    #. For every pair of entries in the table

       #. If they have the same spinnaker_route

          #. Create a merged entry
          #. Check that does not intersect any entry with a different route

             #. Remove the two original entries
             #. Add the merged entry
             #. Start over

    A slightly optimised algorithm is:

    #. Split the entries into buckets based on spinnaker route
    #. Process the buckets one at a time

       #. For each entry in the buckets

          #. For each other entry in the bucket

             #. Create a merge entry
             #. Make sure there is no clash with an entry in another bucket
             #. Replace the two entries and add the merge
             #. Start the bucket over

          #. If no merge found move the entry from the bucket to the result\
             list

       #. When the bucket is empty the result list becomes the bucket

    A farther optimisation is to do the whole thing in place in a single list:

    #. Step 1 is sort the list by route in place
    #. Step 2 do the compression route by route using indexes into the array

       #. The array is split into 6 parts.

          #. 0 to _previous_pointer(-1): \
                    Entries in buckets that have already been compressed
          #. _previous_pointer to _write_pointer(-1): \
                    Finished entries for the current bucket
          #. _write_pointer to left(-1): \
                    Unused space due to previous merges
          #. left to right: \
                    Not yet finished entries from the current bucket
          #. right(+ 1) to _remaining_index(-1): \
                    Unused space due to previous merges
          #. _remaining_index to max_index(-1): \
                    Entries in buckets not yet compressed

    #. Step 3 use only the entries up to _write_pointer(-1)

    A farther optimisation is to uses order.
    The entries are sorted by route frequency from low to high.
    The results are considered ordered so previous routes are not \
    considered.

    The advantage is this allows all the entries from the most frequent \
    route to be merged into a single entry. And the second most \
    frequent only has to consider the most frequent routes.

    Step 1 requires the counting of the frequency of routes and the \
    sorting the routes based on this frequency.
    The current tie break between routes with the same frequency is \
    the route but this is arbitrary at the algorithm level.
    This code does not use a dictionary to keep the code the same as \
    the C.

    Step 2 is change in that the previous entries \
    (0 to _previous_pointer(-1)) are not considered for clash checking
