"""An explicit representation of a routing tree in a machine.

This representation of a route explicitly describes a tree-structure and the
complete path taken by a route. This is used during place and route in
preference to a set of RoutingTableEntry tuples since it is more easily
verified and more accurately represents the problem at hand.

Based on
https://github.com/project-rig/rig/blob/master/rig/place_and_route/routing_tree.py
