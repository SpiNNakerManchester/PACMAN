        # Which implementation is best is a difficult question to answer:
        # * In principle nets with quite localised connections (e.g.
        #   nearest-neighbour or centroids traffic) may route slightly more
        #   quickly with the original algorithm since it may very quickly find
        #   a neighbour.
        # * In nets which connect very spaced-out destinations the second
        #   implementation may be quicker since in such a scenario it is
        #   unlikely that a neighbour will be found.
        # * In extremely high-fan-out nets (e.g. broadcasts), the original
        #   method is very likely to perform *far* better than the alternative
        #   method since most iterations will complete immediately while the
        #   alternative method must scan *all* the route vertices.
        # As such, it should be clear that neither method alone is 'best' and
        # both have degenerate performance in certain completely reasonable
        # styles of net. As a result, a simple heuristic is used to decide

    This algorithm attempts to use NER to generate routing trees for all nets
    and routes around broken links using A* graph search. If the system is
    fully connected, this algorithm will always succeed though no consideration
    of congestion or routing-table usage is attempted.

    Parameters
    ----------
    radius : int
        Radius of area to search from each node. 20 is arbitrarily selected in
        the paper and shown to be acceptable in practice. If set to zero, this
        method is becomes longest dimension first routing.
